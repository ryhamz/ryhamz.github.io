I've been putting off this side project for a while, but finally decided to get it together. Today will be my first blog post on ryhamz.github.io.

Here it is.

While I'm not sure if I ever want to steamline the content on here, I do have some ideas.

Things that I am interested in:

* Software Engineering

* Basketball

* Motorcycle

* Startups

* Exploration


We're going to start off with a mix of these and the blog is part of my new committment to investing in myself daily, at least a little bit. Incremental progress works and a blog is a good fit to track that. We're going to be reading technical documentation, improving our bodies, and learning how to live on here. Let's go.
